### Card Layout
Lists of Charts and Dashboards are shown in a new format using a grid of thumbnails. This makes it easier to discover and find Charts and Dashboards, especially when there is a lot of them in your Superset instance.

### Explore Controls
Visualization controls have been updated to create a more consistent and modernized interface. Refactoring includes updates to the content/labeling/ordering of these controls as well as updating their styling and simplifying their interactions and layout. This will line us up for features like drag-and-drop controls, and dynamically populated control inputs.

### Component Library
This release is a major milestone in an ongoing effort to modernize, consolidate, and simplify the interface elements of Superset.

This will ease developer experience and create a more consistent and modern aesthetic for the user.
